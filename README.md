Dice-Game
=========

A dice game created with php and jquery. The the front end operates on the bootstrap framework. 
The game accepts a dynamic number of players/names and rounds for the game. Each player takes turns rolling the dice. 
A player scores points when they roll same number in multiples of greater than 3(i.e. 3 of a kind, 4 of a kind, 5 of
a kind). If a player rolls only a 2 of a kind on their first roll they will roll a second time to try to earn some 
points. A player earns 3 points for a 3 of a kind, 6 points for 4 of kind,and 12 points for matching all 5. The player 
with the most points at the end of the game wins.
